# AlmaLinux Mirrors

Mirrors are extremely important to provide fast, reliable infrastructure.
We are very grateful to all of the AlmaLinux Mirror Operators, people and organizations that have setup and maintain mirrors.

AlmaLinux would like to personally thank [HiVelocity](https://www.hivelocity.net/) for their sponsorship of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation and sponsorship of our primary rsync mirror and bandwidth. Please support those that support the community. Check out [HiVelocity](https://www.hivelocity.net/) for all your dedicated server, bare metal, colo, CDN and hosting needs.
